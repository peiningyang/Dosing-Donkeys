# Dosing Donkeys

This is a ShinyApp that allows users to enter the length, girth, height, Body Condition Score (BCS) and age of a donkey and return an estimated weight in order to provide an adequate dosage of medication since it is difficult to get the specific weight of a donkey. 

Users can refer to the lower bounds of the 95% confidence interval of the estimation for fear of overdosing. Users will also be alerted if the length, girth or height entered is outside of the normal range.
